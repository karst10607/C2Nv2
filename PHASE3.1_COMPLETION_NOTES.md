# Phase 3.1: Core MediaProcessor - Completion Notes

## Summary
Phase 3.1 successfully created the foundation for a flexible media processing system that starts with current image functionality but is architected for future expansion.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. MediaProcessor Core (`src/processors/media_processor.py`)
- **MediaType Enum**: Comprehensive enumeration of supported media types (IMAGE, DOCUMENT, PDF, VIDEO, etc.)
- **MediaItem Class**: Represents any media item with type, size, metadata, and source information
- **ProcessedMedia Class**: Result of processing with Notion block type mapping
- **MediaInventory Class**: Tracks all media found with summaries by type and size

### 2. Handler Architecture
- **MediaHandler ABC**: Abstract base class for type-specific handlers
- **ImageHandler**: Concrete implementation for image processing
- Extensible design for future handlers (DocumentHandler, VideoHandler, etc.)

### 3. Key Features
- **Directory Scanning**: `scan_directory()` recursively finds all media files
- **Type Detection**: Extensive file extension mapping (40+ extensions)
- **Inventory Tracking**: Detailed statistics on media types and sizes
- **HTML Integration**: `process_html_image()` for parser compatibility
- **Block Operations**: Maintained compatibility with existing image counting/extraction

### 4. Integration Points
- Updated `importer.py` to show media inventory during import
- Modified `verification.py` to use MediaProcessor for image extraction
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Design Decisions

1. **Expanded Scope**: Instead of just ImageProcessor, created MediaProcessor to handle all media types
2. **Lazy Imports**: Used local imports in methods to avoid circular dependencies
3. **Type Safety**: Used TYPE_CHECKING for bs4 imports to avoid runtime dependencies
4. **Extensibility**: Handler pattern allows easy addition of new media types

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests verifying:
- File extension to MediaType mapping
- Block counting logic
- Media inventory functionality
- All tests passed successfully

## Next Steps (Phase 3.2 & 3.3)

### Phase 3.2: Advanced Media Support
- SVG to PNG conversion
- Document preview generation
- Diagram extraction (Draw.io, PlantUML)
- Enhanced metadata extraction

### Phase 3.3: Conversion Pipeline
- Media optimization (image compression)
- Format conversion workflows
- Batch processing capabilities
- Progress tracking for long operations

## Files Changed
- Created: `src/processors/__init__.py`, `src/processors/media_processor.py`
- Modified: `src/importer.py`, `src/verification.py`, `src/html_parser.py`
- Updated: `REFACTORING_PLAN_V3.md`

## Time Spent
Approximately 1.5 hours (significantly under the 4-5 hour estimate due to focused scope)
